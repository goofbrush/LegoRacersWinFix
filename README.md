# LegoRacersWinFix

Fixing LegoRacers maximising issues.

## Usage
- Either compile winfix.cpp or use the executable in the releases
- Place the executable in the same folder as the Lego Racers program file
- Run the fix in admin

To automate the process you can also place the batch file in the game folder and run

## Troubleshooting
- If your game doesnt open in admin by default, try removing lines 1-9 in the batch file to run everything without elevated permissions
- If you have a File Explorer open on a folder with the exact name "LEGO Racers", this might cause issues, so either change the name of the folder, or create a shorcut to the batch file somewhere and close out
